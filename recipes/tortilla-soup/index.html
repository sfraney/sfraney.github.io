<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 quarts <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/save-your-vegetable-scraps-make-stock" title="Save Your Vegetable Scraps, Make Stock">homemade vegetable scrap stock</a> (or other stock, if necesary)</li>
<li>1 package (12 oz.?) firm tofu</li>
<li>1 large onion, split in half, plus 1 large onion, finely diced (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
<li>2 ears of corn, shucked, kernels removed from cobs, milk scraped from empty cobs
<ul>
<li>We usually just use a can of corn, where all of the liquid acts as the &ldquo;milk&rdquo; and about 1/2 of the corn kernels are used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 medium garlic cloves, whole, plus 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)</li>
<li>3 whole dried ancho chilies, seeds and stems removed, flesh roughly torn into strips</li>
<li>1 1/2 pounds ripe tomatoes, split in half
<ul>
<li>We usually just use a can (14.5 oz.) of diced tomatoes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 poblano pepper, seeded and finely diced (about 1 cup)
<ul>
<li>Bell pepper substitutes fine.  Jalapeno would be good if you want more spice (but the ancho usually does well enough in the spice department).  This is mostly about texture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
<li>2 tesapoons dried oregano</li>
<li>1 cup fresh cilantro leaves</li>
<li>1 tablespoon corn flour</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="to-serve">To Serve:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Diced avocado</li>
<li>Fried tortilla strips or chips</li>
<li>Chopped scallions</li>
<li>Lime wedges</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Place stock, split onion, empty corn cobs and scraped corn milk, 2 whole garlic cloves, and chilies in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook for 30 minutes. Discard onion, corn cobs, and garlic cloves (or dump into vegetable scrap stock freezer bag after they&rsquo;ve cooled enough).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meanwhile, cut tofu into 1/2 inch cubes, heat a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil in cast iron skillet, and fry tofu until desired crispiness is reached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(we usually skip this) Adjust rack to 4 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place tomatoes cut side-up on a foil-lined broiler pan and broil until charred on top surface and completely softened, about 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine roasted tomatoes, stock, and re-hydrated chilies in the bowl of a blender. Blend on high speed until completely smooth and set aside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions, poblanos, and corn kernels. Season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add cumin and oregano and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds longer. Add half of cilantro and stir to combine. Pour tomato-chili stock into the pot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whisk corn flour into soup. Bring to a simmer, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Let cook, stirring frequently, until onions and poblanos are totally softened, 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add fried tofu and serve soup, garnished with avocado, fried tortilla strips, scallions, lime wedges, and remaining cilantro.</p>
</li>
</ol>
