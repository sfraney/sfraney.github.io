      <p>We recently bought one of the ‚Äúblack bag‚Äù ramen packets by <a href="https://www.samyangfoods.com/eng/index.do" title="Samyang">Samyang</a>. It wasn‚Äôt the hottest I‚Äôve ever had (IIRC, the ‚Äú3x spicy‚Äù stuff might have been the hottest I‚Äôve experienced), but the flavor of the sauce was really good. I wanted to be able to make it at home and didn‚Äôt figure it would be too hard. A quick search popped up a few <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/5tgxzs/korean_fire_noodle_sauce_ratiorecipe/">reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/comments/bg036f/week_14_copycat_recipes_samyang_buldak_bokkeum/">posts</a> (or <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/dlsck00/80195261340">redirections</a>) that were relatively consistent, so I gave a modified version a try.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1T gochujang</li>
<li>1T gochugaru (lacking proper gochugaru, I used <a href="https://mamastarchilioil.com/product/combo-chili-oil/">Mama Star‚Äôs combo chili oil</a>)</li>
<li>2t soy sauce</li>
<li>3-4 medium cloves garlic, minced/pressed/grated</li>
<li>~1/4t Hot Sauce (e.g., <a href="https://heatonist.com/products/culleys-fire-water">Cully‚Äôs Fire Water</a>)</li>
<li>0.5t sesame oil (I just used some of the oil from the combo chili oil above)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>Mix it all together‚Ä¶</p>
<h2 id="modifications">Modifications</h2>
<p>This is wide open for modifications. Mixing quantities and types of chili peppers, hot sauce, and garlic are on the top of my list to tweak.</p>
<p>In particular, it was noted that my version was a little more vinegary than the packet. I think I‚Äôll replace the Cully‚Äôs Fire Water with some <a href="https://heatonist.com/collections/hottest-hot-sauces/products/hot-ones-the-last-dab">Last Dab XX</a> that I also happen to have on hand. Along with toning down the vinegar, it should amp up the spice a little. While the initial version had a good kick to it, I would like to push it up a little.</p>
<p>Also, I‚Äôd like to take this as an opportunity to make my own gochujang. It seems like a nice melding of two of my favorites: hot stuff and fermentation.</p>
