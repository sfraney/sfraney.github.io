      <p>Adapted, by using pre-made Maesri red curry paste, from <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/phat-phrik-khing-with-tofu-long-beans-dry-fry-thai-curry-vegan-recipe" title="">Serious Eats</a></p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons (45ml) vegetable oil or coconut oil</li>
<li>1 (12-ounce; 340g) block firm tofu, cut into 1- by 1- by 1/2-inch squares, pressed firmly between paper towels</li>
<li>1 pound (450g) green beans or long beans, trimmed and cut into 1 1/2-inch lengths</li>
<li>1 tablespoon (14g) sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce</li>
<li>Steamed jasmine rice, for serving</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil in a wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tofu, spread into a single layer, and cook, occasionally shaking pan gently, until crisp on first side, about 3 minutes. Flip tofu and continue cooking until second side is crisp. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Add another tablespoon (15ml) oil to the wok and increase heat to high. When oil is smoking, add beans and cook, stirring and tossing occasionally, until blistered and tender, about 3 minutes. Transfer to bowl with tofu.</li>
<li>Add remaining tablespoon (15ml) oil to wok and return to high heat until lightly smoking. Add curry paste all at once and cook, stirring continuously, until aromatic and sizzling, about 1 minute. Return tofu and beans to pan, along with sugar and soy sauce. Stir and toss to combine and coat tofu and beans in curry paste. Season to taste with more salt if desired. Serve immediately with steamed jasmine rice.</li>
