<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Enough tallow to get about 1&quot; depth in your frying pan</li>
<li>3 pounds chicken wings, cut into drumettes and flats</li>
<li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
<li>3 tablespoons hot sauce (Frank&rsquo;s, sriracha, or something more daring)</li>
<li>Ranch or <a href="https://sfraney.github.io/recipes/blue-cheese-dressing/">Blue Cheese</a> dressing</li>
<li>Celery sticks</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Spread wings out on a rack-lined rimmed baking sheet.  Pat dry with a paper towel and salt.  Don&rsquo;t overdo the salt, &lsquo;cause these don&rsquo;t have a lot of meat on them.  Place in refrigerator to allow salt to penetrate, at least 1 hour up to overnight<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place oil and chicken wings in a large cast iron skillet. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until it registers 225 to 250¬∞F on an instant-read thermometer (chicken should be gently bubbling). Continue to cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 225 to 250¬∞F until chicken is cooked through and skin is tender but not crisp or browned, about 20 minutes total. Transfer chicken with a wire mesh spider to a rimmed baking sheet lined with paper towels. Allow chicken to rest at room temperature for at least 1 hour, or cover and rest in the fridge for up to three nights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When ready to serve, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heat oil to 400¬∞F. Carefully add one third of chicken and cook, stirring and flipping chicken occasionally while adjusting heat to maintain a temperature of 375 to 400¬∞F until golden brown and crisp, about 10 minutes total. Transfer to bowl with sauce, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combine 1 part butter with 1 part hot sauce in a bowl<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.  Add wings to bowl, toss to coat, and serve with blue cheese dressing and celery. Repeat with remaining batches, serving one batch at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to sauce one batch of wings while others are frying, preheat an oven to 200¬∞F and place sauced wings in oven on rack-lined rimmed baking sheet until all wings are done.  This keeps the wings warm and seems to help set the sauce to prevent them from being too saucy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<p>I agree, these <em>are</em> the best chicken wings.  They are juicy and tender inside with a thin crackling skin on the outside that holds sauce well.</p>
<h3 id="next-time">Next Time</h3>
<p>I under-sauced this initial batch so they weren&rsquo;t very hot (even the ones coated in super-hot hot sauces, like <a href="https://heatonist.com/products/hellfire-kranked-1?variant=39373094060130" title="Heatonist Hellfire Kranked Store Page">Hellfire Kranked</a>, but they still tasted awesome.  All the wings got a coating of <a href="https://www.seedranchflavor.com/products/umami-everyday-sauce" title="Seed Ranch Umami Everyday Sauce Page">Umami Everyday Sauce</a> (because I didn&rsquo;t clean out the bowl after treating the first wings with them and sauce remained) which couldn&rsquo;t have hurt, that sauce creates a great base flavor.</p>

<p>I found 1 teaspoon hot sauce to 1 teaspoon butter to be a good coating for 4 - 6 wings.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
