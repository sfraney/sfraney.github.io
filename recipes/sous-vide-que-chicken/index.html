I combined this recipe with the sous-vide-que process on AmazingRibs.com in an effort to get tender, juicy ribs along with a nice, tested flavor. The sous-vide-que ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù (which is really just a description of an experiment) only mentioned a rub that I don‚Äôt have and the taste of Meathead‚Äôs grilled chicken breasts sounded good.</p>
<p>I also put to work the breast pieces I acquired from my chicken breakdown for ramen. We don‚Äôt usually buy chicken breast (because thighs are generally cheaper, are harder to mess up, and generally taste better) so I‚Äôd been trying to figure out how to make the most of these breasts. I think I accomplished that here.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Breast portions of 1 medium-sized chicken, broken down</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marinade">Marinade</h2>
<ul>
<li>1/4 C Seasoned Rice Wine Vinegar</li>
<li>1/4 C Apple Cider Vinegar</li>
<li>1/3 cup dry white wine</li>
<li>Loose 1/4 C (probably ~1/5 C) brown sugar, light or dark</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Dijon-stye mustard</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, light or dark</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
<li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
<li>Dry brine the meat by salting it about 4 hours before cooking. This gives the salt a chance to penetrate.</li>
<li>Put all the marinade ingredients into a bowl and whisk it together. Pour into a zipper bag. Per Meathead‚Äôs article on the science of marinades, they do not penetrate very far. But they do find their way into cracks and cuts. So add the meat to the bag about 2 hours before cooking. And if you want, cut diamond patterns in the surface of both sides about 1/8‚Ä≥ deep. These grooves with gather and hold the marinade.</li>
<li>Prepare sous vide machine to 150¬∞ F, immerse chicken in marinade, leave in bath for 1.5 to 4 hours.</li>
<li>Prepare grill for direct heat, timing to be ready when the breasts are done. Sear breasts over direct flame, covered if the grill flares up, until nice grill marks are formed (~5 minutes per side).</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<p>This was a really great chicken breast. It was nice and juicy with tender meat. The marinade tasted great, but was a little too faint for me. I didn‚Äôt bother making the diamond pattern cuts like I should have. We actually ate this with the Indian Spiced Chickpea Gravy, whose strong flavor over-powered the chicken. Individually, both recipes are great. They don‚Äôt work so well together, though.</p>
<p>Since I‚Äôd sous vide it, I was able to reduce the marinade while the chicken was on the grill. At the time, I didn‚Äôt have a plan for it, but it worked well to pour over the chicken to amp up the flavor.</p>
<p>##Modifications</p>
<p>Next time, I‚Äôd like to follow Meathead‚Äôs suggestion to score the chicken in a diamond pattern to get more of the marinade flavor without having to add sauce.</p>
