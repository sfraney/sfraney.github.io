<p>The top 7 of this list will possibly become family staples. The rest didn‚Äôt gain widespread ‚Äì if any ‚Äì support and probably won‚Äôt be made again.</p>
<ol>
<li>Mejadra
<ul>
<li>Major ingredients: Lentils, Rice</li>
<li>Preparation notes: Frying onions may splatter =&gt; use splatter protection (e.g., wok w/ frywall)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cauliflower General Tso‚Äôs ‚Äì variant of <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/04/the-best-general-tsos-chicken-food-lab-chinese-recipe.html">Kenji&rsquo;s The Best General Tso&rsquo;s Chiken</a>
<ul>
<li>This is so good! I want to put it up to #1, but need to let my excitement settle to get some perspective.
<ul>
<li>The sauce and fried cauliflower are awesome by themselves and made better together</li>
<li>Fried cauliflower has a great crunchiness and the little chunks of fried dredge that stick to them are so good</li>
<li>Sauce has a good sweetness without being cloying (like Kenji was going for) and it‚Äôs got some heat without being overwhelming</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replace chicken with 1 large head of cauliflower cut into bite sized pieces</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt put as much marinade in the dredge as the recipe says
<ul>
<li>Ended up with large chunks and had to add flour to get the right consistency (luckily there was a picture of what we were going for)</li>
<li>The amount of marinade (with 1/2 in the dredge) was a good amount =&gt; if using less in the dredge, could probably get away with making less marinade
<ul>
<li>OTOH, the amount of dredge was about right with adding ~1/4 C of flour so maybe it just worked out right with our modifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 arbols is plenty (I would be fine with ~4 but more sensitive mouths would prefer no more than 2, and maybe even 1)</li>
<li>Lots of work and messy, but definitely worth it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Falafel
<ul>
<li>Major ingredients: Chickpeas, Cilantro/Parsley/Mint mixture</li>
<li>Preparation notes: Requires soaking chickpeas</li>
<li>Deep frying</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ricotta Gnocchi</li>
<li>Anda Bhurji ‚Äì Spicy Indian Scrambled Eggs</li>
<li>Curried Lentils with Coconut Milk ‚Äì need to thicken better (maybe use coconut cream?) and increase spices (turmeric to ~1T, double cumin &amp; coriander)</li>
<li>Chickpea, Potato, and Spinach Jalfrezi (‚Äúdry‚Äù curry)</li>
<li>Black Bean Burgers</li>
<li>Shakshuka (2/3 liked this, the other was not a fan)
<ul>
<li>Major ingredients: Peppers (mild), Onion, Tomato</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Channa Masala (or my previous post)
<ul>
<li>Preparation notes: Requires soaking chickpeas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Butter Sauce ‚Äì Either this or this ‚Äì I imagine, with a good sauce base, you could add potatoes, chickpeas, paneer, tofu, etc. (and potentially end up making one or the other of the linked recipes)</li>
<li>Chickpea, Cashew, and Coconut Curry (the other 2 seemed to like it fine, though they didn‚Äôt eat the leftovers. I did not like it‚Ä¶)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="untried">Untried</h3>
<ul>
<li>Menemen ‚Äì Turkish variant of Shakshuka
<ul>
<li>Major ingredients: Peppers (mild), Tomato, Egg</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sides">Sides</h2>
<ol>
<li>Hummus ‚Äì I‚Äôve made this a bunch of times, it‚Äôs awesome</li>
<li>Potato Cakes (R√∂sti) (3/3 really liked this)</li>
<li>Tortilla Espa√±ola ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt actually make this, but I think this recipe is pretty close</li>
<li>French Fries (3/3)</li>
<li>Roasted Cabbage (3/3 thought it was better than they expected ‚Äì i.e., it was pretty decent, but it didn‚Äôt all get eaten‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>Onion Rings
<ul>
<li>Excellent crunch</li>
<li>Needs salt. Either incorporate into batter or sprinkle better over cooling rings. I used table salt, maybe just switching to kosher would have helped.</li>
<li>Need to make sure and fry at an appropriate temperature. Fried a little too cool and they ended up pretty greasy (at least the theory is that they would be less greasy at a higher temperature).</li>
<li>A lot of work that creates a lot of mess. Probably not worth the effort, TBH.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="untried-1">Untried</h3>
<ul>
<li>Creamed Spinach</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="soups-in-preference-order">Soups (in preference order)</h2>
<p>The top 6 have pretty widespread support in the house. The Soondubu Jjigae only really appeals to one or two of us, but that‚Äôs enough for it to be acceptable every once in a while. The Black Bean Soup just didn‚Äôt turn out great.</p>
<ol>
<li>Vegan Ramen ‚Äì this stuff is really good, but it requires a time investment and a long grocery list, mostly to make the variety of add-ons necessary to make it a proper bowl of ramen. Sun ramen noodles are highly recommended over dried substitutes.</li>
<li>Potato-Leek Soup ‚Äì very good, but a little thinner than we‚Äôd like. Try 1.5 lb. potato with the 1 qt. stock. 1.25 lb. potato with just over 1 qt. stock was still too thin. Honestly, as written it‚Äôs appropriate, but I think for our taste, thicker is better.</li>
<li>French Onion Soup ‚Äì from the Food Lab</li>
<li>Lentil soup</li>
<li>Gazpacho ‚Äì very good, even though we didn‚Äôt have really ripe tomatoes (they were late January, not-so-ripe tomatoes) and the 30 minutes in the freezer wasn‚Äôt enough to actually freeze the vegetables</li>
<li>Broccoli Cheese Soup ‚Äì minor tweak on Kenji‚Äôs that‚Äôs a small improvement on the nutrition of our house recipe with a nice little incorporation of cheddar flavor. Pairs very well with Mama Star garlic chili oil.</li>
<li>Tofu Tortilla Soup ‚Äì modified version of Kenji‚Äôs Real Deal Tortilla Soup
<ul>
<li>Replaced chicken stock with vegetable scrap stock</li>
<li>Replaced chicken with tofu, fried to crispy crust</li>
<li>Replaced fresh corn &amp; corn ‚Äúmilk‚Äù with canned corn and liquid</li>
<li>Didn‚Äôt have the time to add beans</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spicy Ginger and Carrot Soup</li>
<li>Soondubu Jjigae ‚Äì See below for some sides I want to include next time I make this (from <a href="https://www.koreanbapsang.com/15-korean-vegetable-side-dishes/">https://www.koreanbapsang.com/15-korean-vegetable-side-dishes/</a>)
<ol>
<li>Gamja Jorim (Korean Braised Potatoes)</li>
<li>Sigeumchi Namul (Blanched Seasoned Spinach) ‚Äì this is a real winner. Made with ~5 oz. and we really wished we had more (so I bought a good pound of spinach for a remake).
<ul>
<li>Excellent candidate for cryoblanching. Did the original ~5 oz. with traditional blanch and the other 3 oz. of the package cryoblanched. No discernable difference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dubu Jorim (Braised Tofu)</li>
<li>Gyeranjjim (Korean Steamed Eggs)</li>
<li>Sesame Broccoli</li>
<li>Korean Pickled Garlic (Maneul Jangajji)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Black Bean Soup ‚Äì this seems to have a little spice to it (jalapeno or serrano plus chipotle chili packed in adobo sauce)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="untried-2">Untried</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lettuce Soup</li>
<li>Spanish Chickpea and Spinach Stew With Ginger</li>
