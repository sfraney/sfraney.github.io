<p>The top 7 of this list will possibly become family staples. The rest didn‚Äôt gain widespread ‚Äì if any ‚Äì support and probably won‚Äôt be made again.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/11/mejadra-from-jerusalem.html" title="Mejadra">Mejadra</a>
<ul>
<li>Major ingredients: Lentils, Rice</li>
<li>Preparation notes: Frying onions may splatter =&gt; use splatter protection (e.g., wok w/ frywall)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cauliflower General Tso‚Äôs ‚Äì variant of <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/04/the-best-general-tsos-chicken-food-lab-chinese-recipe.html" title="The Best General Tso's Chicken">Kenji&rsquo;s The Best General Tso&rsquo;s Chicken</a>
<ul>
<li>This is so good! I want to put it up to #1, but need to let my excitement settle to get some perspective.
<ul>
<li>The sauce and fried cauliflower are awesome by themselves and made better together</li>
<li>Fried cauliflower has a great crunchiness and the little chunks of fried dredge that stick to them are so good</li>
<li>Sauce has a good sweetness without being cloying (like Kenji was going for) and it‚Äôs got some heat without being overwhelming</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Replace chicken with 1 large head of cauliflower cut into bite sized pieces</li>
<li>Don‚Äôt put as much marinade in the dredge as the recipe says
<ul>
<li>Ended up with large chunks and had to add flour to get the right consistency (luckily there was a picture of what we were going for)</li>
<li>The amount of marinade (with 1/2 in the dredge) was a good amount =&gt; if using less in the dredge, could probably get away with making less marinade
<ul>
<li>OTOH, the amount of dredge was about right with adding ~1/4 C of flour so maybe it just worked out right with our modifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 arbols is plenty (I would be fine with ~4 but more sensitive mouths would prefer no more than 2, and maybe even 1)</li>
<li>Lots of work and messy, but definitely worth it.</li>

<li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/09/foolproof-onion-rings-food-lab-recipe.html" title="Onion Rings">Onion Rings</a>
<ul>
<li>Excellent crunch</li>
<li>Needs salt. Either incorporate into batter or sprinkle better over cooling rings. I used table salt, maybe just switching to kosher would have helped.</li>
<li>Need to make sure and fry at an appropriate temperature. Fried a little too cool and they ended up pretty greasy (at least the theory is that they would be less greasy at a higher temperature).</li>
<li>A lot of work that creates a lot of mess. Probably not worth the effort, TBH.</li>

<p>The top 6 have pretty widespread support in the house. The Soondubu Jjigae only really appeals to one or two of us, but that‚Äôs enough for it to be acceptable every once in a while. The Black Bean Soup just didn‚Äôt turn out great.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/02/how-to-make-the-ultimate-vegan-ramen-rich-and-creamy-vegan-experience.html" title="Vegan Ramen">Vegan Ramen</a> ‚Äì this stuff is really good, but it requires a time investment and a long grocery list, mostly to make the variety of add-ons necessary to make it a proper bowl of ramen. Sun ramen noodles are highly recommended over dried substitutes.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/01/best-potato-leek-soup-recipe.html" title="Potato-Leek Soup">Potato-Leek Soup</a> ‚Äì very good, but a little thinner than we‚Äôd like. Try 1.5 lb. potato with the 1 qt. stock. 1.25 lb. potato with just over 1 qt. stock was still too thin. Honestly, as written it‚Äôs appropriate, but I think for our taste, thicker is better.</li>
<li>French Onion Soup ‚Äì from the Food Lab</li>
<li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2014/10/easy-lentil-soup-parsley-garlic-lemon-gremolata-recipe.html" title="Lentil soup">Lentil soup</a> - oh yeah, this is very good.  Sort of a staple around the house now.  Using homegrown parsely takes it up a notch.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/08/andalusian-gazpacho-recipe.html" title="Gazpacho">Gazpacho</a> ‚Äì very good, even though we didn‚Äôt have really ripe tomatoes (they were late January, not-so-ripe tomatoes) and the 30 minutes in the freezer wasn‚Äôt enough to actually freeze the vegetables</li>
<li><a href="https://sfraney.github.io/recipes/broccoli-cheese-soup/" title="Broccoli Cheese Soup">Broccoli Cheese Soup</a> ‚Äì minor tweak on Kenji‚Äôs that‚Äôs a small improvement on the nutrition of our house recipe with a nice little incorporation of cheddar flavor. Pairs very well with <a href="https://mamastarchilioil.com/product/combo-chili-oil/" title="Mama Star combo chili oil">Mama Star garlic chili oil</a>.</li>

<li>Excellent candidate for cryoblanching. Did the original ~5 oz. with traditional blanch and the other 3 oz. of the package cryoblanched. No discernable difference.</li>
